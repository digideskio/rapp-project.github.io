This approach aspires to multiple benefits: First of all, we 				enable all developers, eager to join our effort towards establishing robotic cloud services, to take the 				first step by downloading our code and testing it in their own platforms. This will hopefully result in their 				feedback, allowing us to fix possible bugs and improve our software by adding extra functionality. Finally, 				their feedback on the usability of our framework will be of utmost importance, since usability is one of the 				expected outcomes of the RAPP Project.</h3>
